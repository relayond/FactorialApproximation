Very Slow code which approximates n! as n grows. For the love of god, just use the gamma function (i just did this because I was bored)

to do this I get a set of points, and solve a matrix using numpy to find the co-efficients of the polynomial, the accuracy determines the degree of the polynomial

You can plot the function on a graph (like using desmos) and plot x! next to it, for small values, its inaccurate but as x goes to infinity it becomes almost the same.
